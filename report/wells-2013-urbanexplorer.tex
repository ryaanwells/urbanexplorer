\begin{abstract}

This project aims to encourage users to do outdoor cardiovascular
exercise by gamifying the experience with positive encouragement
through a mobile application. By tracking the distance the user
travels in each exercise session through device GPS and translating
this into well-known outdoor pursuits allows the user to quantify
their exercise in terms of well known physical and cultural
achievements. These achievements will take badge-like form where an
incremental reward structure will be used to encourage the user. 

%% Outdoor pursuits will contain: actual routes such as the West Highland
%% Way and the climb to the top of Everest; popular culture references
%% such as ``Route 66'' and the (approximate) distance that \emph{Frodo}
%% and \emph{Sam} travelled in J.R.R.Tolkein's ``The Lord of the Rings'';
%% and Global distances such as the distance between capitol cities and
%% simple metrics such as the first one hundred miles. 

%% The user will exercise with a compatible device on their
%% person. During exercise the device will track and log the distance
%% that the user has travelled and add this to their accumulators. If
%% this device is their smart phone then the Mobile Application will
%% notify them immediately when they have completed an outdoor pursuit,
%% otherwise they will be notified when data is collected from the
%% dedicated hardware.

%% This application will encourage social exercise through outdoor
%% pursuits that can only be completed through teamwork with other users
%% that have met in real life. This intends to extend the influence of
%% rewarding exercise by encouraging users to include their peer group in
%% exercising with them and sharing their successes. For a user,
%% this is incentivised by unlocking achievements only achievable through
%% this social interaction.

An analysis of frequency and duration of exercise with regards to
duration of application use will be used with user feedback to
indicate whether or not gamification techniques could have a valid
application in cardiovascular exercise.
