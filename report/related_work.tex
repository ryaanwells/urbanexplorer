\section{Comparison of related applications}
Incentivising exercise is not a new concept in the mobile market. From
simple applications that mimic a pedometer to immersive alternate
realities, there has been a varied approach to encouraging
exercise. These approaches can be shown through the following
applications.

\subsection{Charity Miles}
Charity Miles encourages you to exercise by facilitating you to help
others as you exercise. For every mile that you run \$0.25 is
donated to a charity of your choice, and for every mile you cycle \$.10
is donated. The money currently comes from a pool gathered by the
parent company so you as an end user don't have to pay anything.

The incentive here is clear - run to donate. In essence, you are both
being paid to exercise and exercising to help out a charity. The
monetary backing allows you to quantify your exercise in terms you are
very familiar with whilst generating the feeling of satisfaction about
helping a charity.
