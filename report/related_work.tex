\section{Gamification and technology in exercise}

Life Fitness in 2012 released a survey concerning technology in the
exercise environment\cite{lifefitness} and it was found that over half of
gym users used a smartphone or tablet when exercising. This study
focused solely on gym users which is not our target market for this
product (we are targeting users who exercise outdoors), however it is
not unreasonable to assume similar statistics for our target
demographic. We use this metric as a basis of platform validity: we
know people use this platform in our targeted situation and so we are
justified to capitalise on this.

\subsection{Targeted users}
The users we are targeting are those who do not exercise often and
those who spend some time travelling on foot outdoors where their
travel is not intentional exercise. 

For users who do not exercise often, we aim to motivate these users to
exercise more frequently by setting a clear reward structure that does
not punish users for taking time between sessions. We also hope that
this encourages these users to travel by foot on journeys that they
otherwise may opt to take transport for. The short term rewards will
initially help these users the most: since they do not exercise
often they may need quicker encouragement to help push them to
exercise more regularly.

With users that spend some time travelling on foot without it being
intentional exercise we should endeavour to retain the thought that it
is not explicit exercise. For these users, the time they spend
travelling on foot may be their morning commute to work or walking
children to school or nursery - time which is not set aside as
exercise time but can still be enhanced by the benefits of
exercise. An extension to their commute may be easily achieved, taking
the ``long route'' for example, where both the long and short term
rewards will encourage the user to spend more time on foot. 

\section{Comparison of related applications}\label{sec_comparison}
Incentivising exercise is not a new concept in the mobile market. From
simple applications that mimic a pedometer to immersive alternate
realities, there has been a varied approach to encouraging
exercise. These approaches can be shown through the following
applications. 

Table \ref{table:competitor_comparison} gives a brief
overview of requrements and user statistics for the compared products
gained from the Google Play Store.

\subsection{Charity Miles}
Charity Miles encourages you to exercise by facilitating you to raise
awareness of charities and help
others as you exercise. For every mile that you run or walk \$0.25 is
donated to a charity of your choice, and for every mile you cycle \$0.10
is donated. The money currently comes from a pool of \$1,000,000
gathered by the parent company - so you as an end user don't have to pay
anything. 

The money you accrue during an exersize session is called your
``sponsorship'' and is only passed onto your charity when you share
your success to a social network (facebook or
twitter)\cite{charitymiles_terms}. Charity Miles say this is to
increase awareness of the charity, but it is also a good advertising
tool for them.

The incentive here is clear - run to donate. In essence, you are both
being paid to exercise and exercising to help out a charity. The
monetary backing allows you to quantify your exercise in terms you are
very familiar with whilst generating a feeling of satisfaction by
helping a charity.

The main drawback here is that there is no defined behaviour for what
happens when the \$1,000,000 pool runs out. From a business
perspective, the app could easily be re-purposed for non-centralised
pool funding where the end user could find local sponsorship. However
this entirely changes the user experience and explicitly requires
effort on the users side to gather this sponsorship. 

\subsection{Zombies, Run!}
\label{sec:zombies}
Zombies, Run! is a companion app that encourages you to exercise through
audio cues, rich story and a base-building game. As you run you are
being ``chased'' by a hoard of zombies that get closer and further
away from you as you exercise - the closer they are to catching you
the louder they become. 

In the app you have a base from where you defend yourself from the
zombie hoard and are required to leave the base to gather
supplies. The story narritive tells you what you need to gather and
you find these supplies based on the distance you travel and the route
you take. Your success is measured by the fortifications of your base,
which you can improve by running faster/further than before.

You are required to wear headphones and carry your mobile phone while
exercising. The headphones give you audio queues to immerse you in the
story, but it is a requirement of the game experience that you listen
to the soundscape provided - you cannot listen to your own music. As
endearing as groaning zombies may be, it is understandable that users
may tire of hearing it. Also, a user may be used to listening to their
own music and use that to zone out of the exercise so some users might
be reluctant to adopt this.


\subsection{WalkJogRun}
\label{sec:walkjogrun}
WalkJogRun helps you discover new routes that are geographically
close to where you are and record your favourite routes to share with
your friends. From your current location it finds and
proposes new exercise routes given a certain route length. It can
provide turn-by-turn direction help when you are exercising to ensure
you do not get lost and will also record an exact route as you run so
you can create a new route with the minimum of effort. 

Your workout is saved and can be later analysed so you can accurately
monitor your progress.

Since the routes are user provided, there is no guarantee that the
routes are safely traversable or applicable to all types of exercise -
a route that can be walked may not be applicable for a runner due to
terrain type, for example. 

There is no clear gamified experience in this application, so the
incentive is self-provided. The user can only use this to improve
their exercise experience as there is not much in the way of
encouragement. 

\subsection{Fitbit}
\label{sec:fitbit}
I have included a comparison with Fitbit products to display other
mediums in which this application can be used. Although it is not
mainly based around a mobile phone use it is an interesting comparison.

Fitbit provide a collection of dedicated hardware devices capable of
accurately measuring your distance travelled (and in some models the
height you have ascended in terms of ``flights of stairs'') as a means
of tracking your activity. At the core, it is a glorified pedometer
with web and phone apps to accompany it and display progress. The
devices and apps also make a prediction about the calories you burn each
day based upon the distance you travel when wearing the device, your
weight and stride length. 

Each device can show you the progress toward your daily goal (either
steps taken or predicted calorie burn) with various visualisation
techniques - the simplest of which is a row of five LED lights that
fill up as you near your goal. Synchronization with compatible phones,
or through a computer if your device is not compatible, allows a more
in depth visualization of your progress.

The gamification aspect is inherent in the design of these products -
you set your own goal and you can easily view your progress at a
glance. Upon completion of your goal the device vibrates and lights up
to notify you. You are also awarded badges for daily completion such
as walking 10,000 steps a day and lifetime completion goals such as
travelling 100 miles in total.

There is a clear downside to this - you are required to purchase a
bespoke device to fully utilize the experience provided by
Fitbit. When compared to an app that may be \$1.99 or thereabouts it is
a much larger startup cost than the previous examples. However this
larger startup cost may be an encouragement unto itself: the user may
feel obligated to commit to using the device since they are more
financially invested, which may help with the onboarding required to
fully benefit from these systems.

Most of these devices are reasonably discreet, the more advanced the
devices get the larger they become. Since these devices must be worn
mainly on the wrist there are social implications involved. Does the
user want everyone to know they are using a fitness tracker? The other
applications are more discreet by design, since they are a mobile app
they can be hidden easier. 

\section{Consideration of competitors concepts in this project
  implementation}
\label{sec:consideration}
Each of the above products utilise gamification in an effective way
and each implementation differs in how they utilise game
elements. This project builds upon some of the design decisions these
competitors have used, aiming to remove some of issues that make the
competitors products either unsustainable or flawed.

First and foremost, this project should not require any form of
additional hardware for the end user or monetary investment. A key
demographic that we are targeting are those users who do not exercise
outside often, so we do not want to create a barrier between those
users and them achieving their exercise goal. This is in reference to
the Fitbit product discussed in Section \ref{sec:fitbit} which
requires a dedicated hardware wristband, and the ``Zombies, Run!'' product
(Section \ref{sec:zombies}) which requires the user to purchase the
mobile app. Both of these could be reasons for an under encouraged
user to not take the first step to starting the exercise process.

This project should also not require a social aspect to achieve the
core goals for this application, unlike WalkJogRun (Section
\ref{sec:walkjogrun}) which has a heavy reliance on social
contributions from users in your area. Although WalkJogRun does not
provide a gamified experience, it does enhance your exercise
experience by showing you new running routes. These routes are user
provided and reliance on crowdsourcing for content, gamified or
otherwise, is too risky for the short period of this project.
