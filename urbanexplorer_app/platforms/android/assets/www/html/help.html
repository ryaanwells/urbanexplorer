      <h3>How do I use urbanexplorer?</h3>
      <p>
	You can use urbanexplorer any time you travel outdoors - just
	launch the app, pick a route and off you go! The app tracks the
	distance you travel and awards you medals for completing the
	route in a certain time.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I get medals?</h3>
      <p>
	You earn a medal for each route you complete. Each route has
	several stages - a route is completed when you complete all the
	stages. Complete the stages faster to bring down the overall
	route time and get better medals!
      </p>
      <h3>What happens if I can't complete a route before I finish
	exercising?</h3>
      <p>
	Don't worry! The app knows where you left off so you can pick
	right up from where you left off :)
      </p>
      <h3>How do you track my distance?</h3>
      <p>
	The app uses your GPS location to track your distance. You need
	an active GPS connection and a data plan to use this app!
      </p>
      <h3>What do you use my GPS location for?</h3>
      <p>
	We only hold onto your last known GPS location to work out how
	far you've travelled since the last time the app told us where
	you are. Nothing more!
      </p>
      <h3>How much data will urbanexplorer use?</h3>
      <p>
	Not much! Every effort has been made to minimise the amount of
	data required. When you're out running the app checks in with
	us about once a minute using your data plan. While every effort
	has been made to minimise the data transfer, you should be aware
	when you are reaching your data limits - we are not responsible
	for any charges incurred when using this app!
      </p>
      <h3>More questions?</h3>
      <p>
	Fire me an email at 1002253w@student.gla.ac.uk and I'll reply
	as soon as I can!
