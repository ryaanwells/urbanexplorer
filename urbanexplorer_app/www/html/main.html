      <p>Thank you for installing urbanexplorer!</p>
      <p>Are you ready to run around the world? Use this app while you
	exercise outdoors to begin your journey - as you run in real
	life you will also be "running" down a route somewhere else in
	the world.</p>
      <p>There are many routes to choose from, and you can complete
	them in any order!</p>
      <p>Each route is broken up into a series of stages that you
	complete along your journey. Complete all the stages on a
	route and you complete that route!</p>
      <p>Don't worry if you can't finish a route - just end your run
	and you can pick up where you left off next time.</p>
      <p>This app requires a GPS signal and a Mobile Data Plan.
	Every effort has been made to minimise mobile data
	transfer. The end user is solely responsible for all charges
	incurred in use of the app and by using this app it is implied
	that you agree to this.</p>
      <p>All data is recorded anonymously and will be used to judge
	the performance of this project.</p>
      <p>This app is an Honours Project by
	Ryan Wells, supervised by Leif Azzopardi.</p>
